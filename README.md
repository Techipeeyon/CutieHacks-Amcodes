## Problem Statement
<p> An Application which helps students to study productively</p>

## Motivation
  <p> At Present students are getting distrubed/distracted alot. In order to improve their focus on studies, we have come up with is application.</p>
  
## Introduction
<ol>
  <p>In this proposed model, we have made separate modules of TO DO list, Note Maker, Pomodoro Alarm and Study Music.</p>
  <p>In the To Do list module, we enable the users to make list and set reminders accordingly.</p>
  <p>In the Note maker module, users can type in notes or can write manually using digital pen</p>
  <p>In Pomodoro Alarm module, users can set timers in order to avoid distraction for a limited period of time.</p>
  <p> This study music module will increase the level of concentration</p>
  
## Pros and Cons of the proposed model

  <p> Students with distracted mind can't focus with their studies. So, we added a feature like whenever users start their work with the timer all other mobile notifications will turn off except calls.
